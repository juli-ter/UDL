# UDL - MAY Demo [WORK IN PROGRESS]
Repository for the SoSe 2025 Course "Understanding Deep Learning", chapters 7 &amp; 8 

# Project Overview
This repository accompanies our demo project for Chapters 7 (Gradients and Initialization) and 8 (Measuring Performance). Our goal is to showcase the effects of different parameter initializations and visualize the bias-variance tradeoff as well as the double descent phenomenon.

# Dataset
We use the Student Habits vs Academic Performance dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jayaantanaath/student-habits-vs-academic-performance). This synthetic dataset contains behavioral and lifestyle factors in students (e.g. study habits, sleep patterns, social media usage, ...), along with their academic results, providing a controlled setting to examine our training dynamics and performance metrics.

# Running the demo [WORK IN PROGRESS]
Once the model is implemented it can be run directly in Google Colab. Any relevant updates, guides and plots will be added to this repository.
